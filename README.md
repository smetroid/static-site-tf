### Objective

Your assignment is to build a terraform configuration that sets up hosting
for the provided index.html file.

### Brief

The crew on the Millennium Falcon is bored. To bolster morale, one of your team members has developed a simple game in the form of a single-page application. You have offered to help her with the setup of the infrastructure side of things.

Your colleague believes that this app will be immensely popular, but has asked that
before it is publically available that it can only be accessed by her in order
to ensure that it meets the required standards.

### Tasks

-   Implement a terraform configuration to create the required infrastructure on AWS.
-   Use terraform to 'deploy' the index.html ( application ) on the AWS infrastructure.
-   Ensure that the application can only be accessed from: 3.121.56.176

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in this repository.

Please provide brief documentation as to why you chose a particular stack/setup.

Ensure that your terraform code can be executed and create the infrastructure
required and 'deploy' the single-page application.

You may use local state or remote state if you so choose.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Terraform best practices.
-   Choice of infrastructure
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
